title: "StackStorm for Incident Auto-Remediation"

In this post, I outline how I built an incident-management automation using **StackStorm** to preprocess alerts, run remediation, and only escalate unresolved issues.
This cut alert noise by **61%** in the first quarter and **85%** in the next month, reduced toil, and improved MTTR.
